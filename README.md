# Task-based multithreaded cURL application for transferring COVID-19 Coronavirus statistics

I've implemented open source libcurl (https://github.com/curl/curl) and json parser (https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) libraries to get COVID-19 statistics of each country worldwide. My goal was to get countriesâ€™ number of confirmed cases and deaths caused by COVID-19 efficiently, hence I've implemented multithreaded task-based parallelism system.
